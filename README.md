## Improvements and Enhancements to be done

**Improvements**
* On Weather Details page I've filtered the grid basis on only temperature(`temperature >= inputStr`). Need to be create generalize filter for any kind of object.
* Currently there is very basic UI, We can also improve this part.

**Enhancments** 
* Currently I didn't got chance to implement **Flux/Redux** with this project,But we can use it in future for better data flow through application 
* We can also modularize the code though I've modularize it upto some level due to time constraint(like specify the Router in different file, etc)
* We need to apply pagination to data grid on Weather Details page.
